Usage
## `Posts Display Screen`:

This screen will display all the created posts.
Each post has an "Edit" button that allows the user to edit the post.
There is a "Create" button at the bottom that redirects to the Create Post Screen.
Create Post Screen:

Users can create new posts by filling out the title and content fields and clicking the "Create" button.
Users can edit existing posts. The title and content fields will be pre-filled with the post's data when accessed via the "Edit" button from the Posts Display Screen.
Upon successful creation or update of a post, the user is redirected back to the Posts Display Screen.
##`State Management`
Redux is used for state management to handle the posts data across the application.
localStorage is used to persist the state of the form inputs for title and content to ensure data is not lost on page reloads.
## Navigation
React Router is used for handling navigation between the Posts Display Screen and the Create Post Screen.
Users can navigate to the Create Post Screen by clicking the "Create" button on the Posts Display Screen.
After creating or editing a post, users are redirected back to the Posts Display Screen.
